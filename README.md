## Important data structures and algorithm in pythonðŸŽ‰ 

#### Arrays and Lists:

- **Arrays:** A fixed-size, contiguous memory data structure.
- **Lists (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList):** Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size.

#### Hash Tables:

- A data structure that maps keys to values, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion.

#### Hash Maps and Sets:

- **Hash Map:** A key-value store with constant-time average lookup.
- **Hash Set:** A set of unique elements with constant-time average membership check.

#### Stacks and Queues:

- **Stack:** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue:** A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

#### Linked Lists:

- **Singly Linked List:** Elements are linked in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Elements are linked in both forward and backward directions.

#### Trees:

- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree with the property that the left subtree contains nodes with values less than the root, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the root.

#### Heaps:

- **Min Heap:** A binary tree where the parent node is smaller than its children.
- **Max Heap:** A binary tree where the parent node is larger than its children.

#### Trie:

- A tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings.

#### Graphs:

- Graphs can come in various forms (e.g., directed, undirected) and are used for modeling relationships between entities.

#### Disjoint Set (Union-Find):

- A data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into disjoint subsets.

#### Priority Queues:

- Data structures like heaps that allow efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority.

#### Bloom Filter:

- A probabilistic data structure used for testing whether an element is a member of a set.

#### LRU Cache:

- A data structure that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching policy.

#### Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are essential for arranging data in a specific order and extracting the required information. Important sorting algorithms include:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

#### Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms help you locate or retrieve elements in various data structures. Common searching algorithms include:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

#### Pattern Searching Algorithms
Pattern searching algorithms are crucial for finding substrings within strings. Prominent pattern searching algorithms include:
- Rabin Karp Algorithm
- KMP Algorithm
- Z Algorithm

#### Divide and Conquer
The divide and conquer strategy breaks down large problems into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively and combining the results. Examples include:
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Matrix Multiplication

#### Backtracking
Backtracking involves trying different solutions for a subproblem until a valid solution is found. It's useful for problems with constraints or choices. Examples include:
- N-Queens
- Rat in a Maze
- Sudoku
- M Coloring Problem

#### Greedy Algorithm
Greedy algorithms find optimal solutions by choosing the best option at each step. They're used in optimization scenarios like maximization and minimization. Examples include:
- Job Sequencing Problem
- Prim's Algorithm for MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Fractional Knapsack Problem

#### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming solves complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, storing results to avoid recomputation. It's used for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Examples include:
- Fibonacci Series
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Knapsack Problem
- Coin Change Problem

#### Tree-Related Algorithms
Trees are hierarchical data structures used for data storage and manipulation. Important tree-related algorithms include:
- Tree Traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
- Binary Search Tree Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Search)
- Height of a Tree
- Diameter of a Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor

#### Graph Algorithms
Graphs represent relationships between data nodes. Common graph algorithms include:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
- Cycle Detection Algorithms (Union Find)
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Kruskal, Prim)
- Topological Sorting

#### Sliding Window
Sliding window is a technique for maintaining a dynamically changing subset of data. It's useful for solving problems within a range or a sequence of data. Examples include:
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size k
- Longest Substring with k Distinct Characters
- Minimum Window Substring
