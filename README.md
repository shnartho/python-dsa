## Important data structures and algorithm in pythonðŸŽ‰ 

### Arrays and Lists:

- **Arrays:** A fixed-size, contiguous memory data structure.
- **Lists (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList):** Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size.

### Stacks and Queues:

- **Stack:** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue:** A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

### Linked Lists:

- **Singly Linked List:** Elements are linked in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Elements are linked in both forward and backward directions.

### Trees:

- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree with the property that the left subtree contains nodes with values less than the root, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the root.

### Heaps:

- **Min Heap:** A binary tree where the parent node is smaller than its children.
- **Max Heap:** A binary tree where the parent node is larger than its children.

### Hash Tables:

- A data structure that maps keys to values, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion.

### Graphs:

- Graphs can come in various forms (e.g., directed, undirected) and are used for modeling relationships between entities.

### Hash Maps and Sets:

- **Hash Map:** A key-value store with constant-time average lookup.
- **Hash Set:** A set of unique elements with constant-time average membership check.

### Trie:

- A tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find):

- A data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into disjoint subsets.

### Priority Queues:

- Data structures like heaps that allow efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority.

### Bloom Filter:

- A probabilistic data structure used for testing whether an element is a member of a set.

### LRU Cache:

- A data structure that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching policy.
