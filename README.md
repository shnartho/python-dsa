# Important Data Structures and Algorithms in Python ðŸŽ‰

### Data Structures:
- **Arrays:** Fixed-size, contiguous memory data structure.
- **Lists:** Dynamic arrays (ArrayList, LinkedList).

### Hashing:
- **Hash Tables:** Map keys to values for efficient retrieval and insertion.
- **Hash Maps:** Key-value store with constant-time average lookup.
- **Hash Sets:** Set of unique elements with constant-time membership check.

### Stacks and Queues:
- **Stack:** Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue:** First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

### Linked Lists:
- **Singly Linked List:** Elements linked in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Elements linked in both directions.

### Trees:
- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Left subtree < root, right subtree > root.

### Heaps:
- **Min Heap:** Parent < children.
- **Max Heap:** Parent > children.

### Trie:
- Tree-like data structure for string storage and retrieval.

### Graphs:
- Various forms (directed, undirected) for modeling relationships.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find):
- Tracks elements in disjoint subsets.

### Priority Queues:
- Efficient access to highest (or lowest) priority elements.

### Bloom Filter:
- Probabilistic data structure for set membership testing.

### LRU Cache:
- Implements Least Recently Used (LRU) caching policy.
